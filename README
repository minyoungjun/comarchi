This directory contains the student distribution of the Y86 tools.  It
is a proper subset of the master distribution, minus the solution
files found in the master distribution.

yas		Y86 assembler
yis		Y86 instruction (ISA) simulator 
hcl2c		HCL to C translator
hcl2v		HCL to Verilog translator
ssim		SEQ simulator
psim		PIPE simulator

1. Building the Y86 tools
*************************

The Y86 simulators can be configured to support TTY interfaces. 
A simulator running in TTY mode prints all information
about its run-time behavior on the terminal.  It's harder to understand what's
going on, but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require any
special installation features.

To build the Y86 tools, perform the following steps:

You can construct the entire set of Y86 tools by typing 

	unix> make clean; make

README
	This file

misc/	
	Source files for the Y86 assembler yas, the Y86 instruction
	simulator yis, and the isa.c file that is used by the -t option
	of the processor simulators to check the results against the
	ISA simulation.  Also contains files for the programs
	hcl2c and hcl2v

seq/	
	Code for the SEQ simulators.  Contains HCL files for
	labs and homework problems that involve modifying SEQ.

pipe/	
	Code for the PIPE simulator.  Contains HCL files for labs and
	homework problems that involve modifying PIPE.

y86-code/
	Example .ys files from CS:APP and scripts for conducting
	automated benchmark teseting of the new processor designs.
